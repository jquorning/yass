      <h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>All commands should be executed in this same directory where file <code>yass</code> is.</li>
<li>We assume that you have installed all program requirements which you can
find in <a href="installation.html">installation</a> chapter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Quick start guide</h2>
<ol>
<li>To create NewSite project type in console <code>./yass create NewSite</code>. This
will create skeletal project in directory <code>NewSite</code>.</li>
<li>Inside newly created directory <code>NewSite</code> you can find file <em>index.md</em> which
later will be main page of site and <em>site.cfg</em> which contains all basic
settings of site. Add some markdown text to <em>index.md</em> file or some new
files to directory <code>NewSite</code>.</li>
<li>When you finish editing project, type in console <code>./yass build NewSite</code>
to build your new site. Effect of this command will be stored (by default)
in directory <code>output</code>.</li>
<li>If you want, you can run program in server mode by typing in console
<code>./yass server NewSite</code>. It will start simple web server which allow you
to preview site in browser. Additionally, it will be monitoring any changes
to files inside project. If any file will be modified, whole site will be
regenerated.</li>
